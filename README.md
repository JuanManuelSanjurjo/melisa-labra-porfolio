## Melisa Labra's Portfolio  

This project is a work-in-progress portfolio for illustrator Melisa Labra. As the client is still finalizing the content and design details, the project is not yet fully completed. However, the current state of the page can be viewed at [Melisa Labra's Portfolio](https://melisa-labra-porfolio.vercel.app/), where it is hosted on Vercel.

The project uses Next.js 14 and App Router, along with Tailwind CSS. Currently, it is in its desktop version with an upcoming adjustment for responsiveness.

The page includes standard portfolio navigation, featuring a landing section, an 'About' section, a 'Contact' section, and various sections displaying the artist's works. These tabs have subcategories accessible through a secondary navigation. Users can view both the image gallery and the expanded versions of each image.

The project also includes a section for content rated over 18 years old. To access this section, users must confirm that they are at least 18 years old. This feature adds an extra layer of age verification to the website, ensuring that only appropriate content is accessed by those who meet the age requirement.
